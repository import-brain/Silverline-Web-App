                            <h5 style="text-align: center;">Rishi Ajmera</h5>
                            <p>Rishi Ajmera is currently a high school senior from Eastern Massachusetts. Rishi’s
                                initiative and concern about the
                                barriers and inequality within education led him to found and run the organization.
                                Rishi’s passion stemmed from his
                                keen interests in math and his private tutoring sessions that he did within his local
                                community. He taught students as
                                young as pre- k all the way till 8th grade, ranging from basic addition and abstraction
                                to SAT math problems. Seeing
                                students excited to learn and excelling in their subject as a result, left Rishi
                                satisfied and wanting to continue
                                teaching. However, he realized how many students don’t get the opportunity of private
                                tutoring often due to a multitude
                                of factors like cost. This led to him to create Silverline Tutoring, a non profit
                                organization that offers free tutoring
                                to everyone regardless of background. As for the experience on the business side of the
                                organization, Rishi has lots of
                                experience within this field. He competes in DECA, an international business
                                competition, and this year he competed in
                                the event, entrepreneurship, qualifying all the way to the international stage. The
                                previous year, Rishi competed in the
                                event, principles of marketing, and qualified for states. Rishi is the president of his
                                school's finance club as well
                                which focuses on many aspects of personal finance such as stocks. Rishi's experience
                                within business has allowed him to
                                excel in the business side of operations of the organization.</p>

                            <p>Ohik is currently a rising high school senior in Northern Illinois. Originally born in Seoul, South Korea, his immigration to the United States introduced huge language barriers that hindered his academic progress. Through this experience, Ohik recognizes the negative impacts academic struggles create and serves to ensure no student is left behind to struggle academically. As the COO, Ohik’s ultimate goal is to expand Silverline and make premium 1 on 1 tutoring sessions free and accessible within mere clicks of a button. As part of his duty and passion, Ohik works closely with all members of the Executive team and Silverline community to guarantee future prosperity and a warm community. Outside of Silverline, he is involved heavily in STEM, participating in his school's year-long Computing Team while launching rockets hundreds of meters into the sky as part of his Rocket Club. He also passionately plays volleyball and tries his best to consistently go to the gym. Ohik is excited about the future of Silverline and fights against academic injustice. He hopes that through Silverline, he can make education available to everyone. </p>

Nolan plans to integrate Silverline Tutoring into schools by creating club chapters under our umbrella.

                            <p>Shivam is currently a rising senior in Northern Illinois. He spends his weekday mornings working with ESY children seeking extra support over summer at a local elementary school and frequently travels during the school year for Track & Field, Soccer, and ModelUN. His active participation and energetic attitude in both his school and neighboring communities has suited him as the Human Resources head for Silverline Tutoring. As a student who’s received tutoring himself, Shivam’s found that tutoring agencies often overprice their services and neglect to offer free resources that educated communities flourish and rely upon for academic success. As the Chief Human Resources Officer, Shivam communicates extensively with students and tutors to allow services to occur instantly, and serves to provide opportunities for students to take advantage of. During the school year, he leads his SkillsUSA club and competes at the world level for VEX Robotics. Through his collaboration with faculty and his team to prepare for competitions, he’s able to instantly connect with individuals across the globe, with everlasting discussions in politics, school, and life in general, always available to provide advice. Going forward, Shivam hopes that Silverline Tutoring’s services will be more accessible for students without the necessary technological means and is excited to see the up and coming developments. </p>

Ever since a young age, the internet and business have always intrigued him. He always looks at ways that these 2 things can be improved in any organization he works with as well as their application being combined. It is something that he loves and aspires to do evidenced by his projects all the way back in elementary school using google maps to find the most effective path to sell candy and what to say by looking at the street on which he is on to sell the candy. This is just one of many things he has done but he is not satisfied! Using technology and his experience in business he looks to find interesting ways to further any organization he is apart of. His experience in technology is evidenced by his extensive understanding of business solutions evidenced by him winning hackathons as well as attending the coveted-DECA SCDC competition.

                                    Executive Officer</h6>
                                <p>Ramon Perez is currently a high school sophomore in South Florida. Being an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, he had to use educational resources to help him integrate himself into his new situation. Outside of school, he loves to participate in Public Forum debate, where he is the captain of the event at his school and the highest-ranked sophomore in his state. Alongside the competitive aspect of the debate, he created a website, PublicForumNow.com, to create high-quality debate resources free of charge for any student. He plans to study Political Science and Economics because he believes he can use the knowledge he learns in these fields to improve the world around him. Ramon’s personal experience with resources like Silverline and inequality in academia has given him the drive to give that access to students who were in his position. Going forward he plans to expand the organization and give many more kids an opportunity to improve their grades at school and create a passion for learning.</p>

                                    Technology Officer</h6>
                                <p>Tarun is currently a rising high school junior in Eastern Massachusetts. His interest in
                                    tutoring as well as development allowed him to fit in at Silverline as the technology
                                    head. Tarun’s passion in tutoring mainly came after running math workshops for the NSF
                                    foundation where he taught 1st - 5th graders the basics of competition math in
                                    anticipation of an upcoming exam. From such experiences, he was left with a rewarding
                                    feeling that instilled his passion for teaching. Today, he continues to volunteer for
                                    such organizations and works as a teacher. On the technology side, Tarun has been
                                    featured on NBC Boston for his work in assisting small businesses in his area with web
                                    applications. After the main wave of Covid-19, Tarun saw that smaller businesses were
                                    severely disadvantaged and suffering. As a result, he started an initiative through a
                                    social media campaign to attract small business owners. The post blew up, and in the
                                    end, he assisted a total of 7 businesses in his area. His years of experience in the computer science field and
                                    passion for helping others have allowed him to thrive as the technology head of
                                    Silverline Tutoring Services.</p>

                            <p>Ashton is a freshman at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University for Aerospace Engineering.
                                He has always found that the
                                biggest obstacle in learning to be contextualizing concepts, and figure out how ideas
                                fit in with real life. At this
                                point, Ashton has been with Silverline for over a year, and tutors programming through
                                Python and Rust, general computer
                                science ideas, and any math below calculus 2. Ashton is a big believer in the idea that
                                programming and math are
                                subjects that people either expressly love or hate: People are never taught the ideas
                                behind the formulation and
                                routines they learn. Ashton hopes to help students find and understand those bigger
                                ideas, and hopefully gain a deeper
                                appreciation for topics that can be very useful in the modern world.</p>
